This is the official implementation of the model LaMOSNet from the paper "LaMOSNet: Latent Mean-Opinion-Score Network for Non-intrusive Speech Quality Assessment". LaMOSNet is a non-intrusive speech quality metric that given an input signal, predicts the overall quality.

## Training

To train, download the VCC2018 data and use the preprocessed csv files added in the data folder.
